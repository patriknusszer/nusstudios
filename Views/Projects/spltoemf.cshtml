@section description {
    When printing a temporary SPL file is generated by Windows
    that contains all the pictures waiting to be processed by the
    printer. This application aims to extract the vector images in 
    their original format. This SPL file is deleted after printing
    unless a specific registry entry is modified. Google it.
