@section description {
    TF Games Util++ is the final version of my encoder/decoder written for the Cybertronian games in C++.

    If the configuration is for console (XBOX or PS3), then press "b" for Big Endian, or if it is for Windows, press "l" for Little Endian.

    TF_Games_Util++ does not use any builtin classes or functions, except the ones for C memory management, so everything it does is defined in the source low level, from character encodings to KMP pattern matching through dynamic array management.
