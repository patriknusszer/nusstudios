    A library of Java utilities
}

@section description {
    This library contains the most common functions I use while programming Java.
    It contains a downloader class. It can send GET requests in one single static function
    in which you can specify the most important aspects of the connection. It has a complex
    callback system communicating with JSON objects.<br>
    It contains an IO library. It contsains read/write functions to make certain tasks easy.
    There is for example a function that will walk through a directory system while
    reporting every node (files and directories).<br>
    It contains StringMath, a very basic math library for string variables.<br>
    It has a base converter that converts a fraction from a base into another (up to base 16).<br>
    There is a byte array to integer/double and integer/double to byte array converter class that you can
    configure with endianness. It can read variable encoded unsigned integers as well.<br>
    And finally there is a bit handling utility which you can use to quickly access certain bits
    in a byte. A function will return a sequence of bits from a byte array given a byte position,
    bit position (little endian-like), requested number of bits, and whether you are reading towards
    the most or the least singificant bit. There is a write function with similar parameters to insert a sequence
    of bits into a byte array.
