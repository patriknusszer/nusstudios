    This is a console application with both param and UI mode. You can use regular expressions to select the files to enumerate
    and you must create exactly 1 group including the digits in the filename. There is an 'original' nuilt in regex for processing
    images of names somename_0.jpg, dsjgftra_1.jpg, dgregre_3.jpg. It is ".*?_(\\d*?).jpg". Yes, there may be missing numbers in the order, you can define min and max...
    For other patterns, you need to know regular expressions. Also, as it is passed as a string, always double escape characters.
