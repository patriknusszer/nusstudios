@section description {
    This application is the equivalent of Nuss Desktop, a very good
    JavaFx port that runs on the most important desktop operating systems.
    Now that the application's code grew bigger, I decided not to maintain all 3 versions' source
    code, therefore the chrome extension and the .NET variant was marked deprecated.
    This project is educational, you are not meant to keep its output.
