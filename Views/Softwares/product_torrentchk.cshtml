@section description {
    This tool was created to hash all the pieces of your torrent download and match against
    the piece hash found inside the provided torrent metafile. The result is either that
    all the pieces passed the hash checking, or that the last piece failed the checking,
    in which case the application does not go on checking the other pieces.
    The application will only work with a torrent metafile, it will not automatically
    retrieve it from a magnet URI, sorry for that. The application was built with .NET Core so it
    is cross platform.
