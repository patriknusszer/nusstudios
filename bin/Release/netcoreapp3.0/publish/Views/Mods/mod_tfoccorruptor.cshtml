@section description
{
    My last version of the infamous corruptor made for Transformers: Fall of Cybertron. When the configuration is missing any kind of element that's already applied, corruption occurs. Since the .customchar file is synced with everyone's Steam account, it causes permanent corruption that can not be fixed by reinstalling the game or Windows.
    This configuration is a fake mod which misses the base required parts.
