    A little bitwise cryptographic tool

@section description {
    It is a cross-platform .NET Core application that crypts your files
    with XOR or XNOR. It either accepts a typed key, or a file as key.
    It can also generate keys of a given size, which is useful n case of XOR.
    If you generate a key that is the size of the file you want to encrypt,
    the chance of the key being "cracked" is little, since the key is never
    repeated/recursed. If the key is smaller than the input, then it is usually applied
    in a recursive manner, resetting the key byte index to 0 at the ned of it.
    If the plain text/input has many 0 bits, then the resulting cipher text will
    reflect the bit of the key due to XOR. The key can be guessed if the cipher text is
    analyzed for constantly repeating bit sequences. This can be avoided by generating
    a a random key of the size of the plain text. In case of XNOR, the opposite is the case.
    The reflection can be seen when applying it to many 1 bits.
